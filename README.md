# Probability Experiment Simulator

This project simulates a probability experiment where colored balls are drawn from a hat. It calculates the likelihood of drawing a specific combination of balls based on the number of trials.

## Features

- **Customizable Hat**: Create a hat with a specified number of colored balls.
- **Random Drawing**: Simulate the random drawing of balls.
- **Probability Calculation**: Determine the probability of drawing a desired combination of balls over multiple experiments.
